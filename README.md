# Oscilloscope using Arduino and Processing
Sampling oscilloscope with 4 channels (voltages from 0 to 5V), with frequencies up to 3kHz.

It has a PWM signal generator and a square wave output.

It can also automatically identify the resistor or capacitor value using 3 scales for better approximation.

The Garagino microcontroller (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07RsKU6-oTo) was used, but it is fully compatible with Arduino (www.arduino.cc).

I used the programming language "Processing" (www.processing.org) to create the program on the computer.

See the [demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw_kyDAiNak) on youtube.

## Improvements for the future

- Show voltages 110/220 Vac

- Increase frequency capacity using more powerful microcontrollers.

- Use bluetooth connection to connect oscilloscope to mobile phone (Android)
